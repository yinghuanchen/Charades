# Charades 
[Live Demo](https://yinghuanchen.github.io/Charades/) 

## 1. Overview 
Charades has always been a party game hit. It is a word guessing game, with one player acting without any spoken language and the other players guessing. In my app, instead of acting, the acter draw for guesser to guess the answer.

* When the round start, Acter can start drawing and Guesser has only 60 seconds to guess for correct answer. Acter can change color and clear all while drawing.

* The score board will record the total rounds which Guesser answer correctly and the total rounds which Guesser has played.
